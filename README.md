### Built With

<ul>
	<li>MySQL</li>
	<li>NodeJS</li>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory to which it is saved. Use the command 'npm install' to install all required dependencies. Export 'schema.sql' found in the 'db' folder to your MySQL server dashboard. You can also just copy the queries directly into MySQL. Once the database is created, create a file named '.env' in the root directory of the app, and add to it your environment variables as outlined by the '.env.example' file. Once all of this is done, simply enter the command 'node index' to start the app.
